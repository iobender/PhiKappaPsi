	<h1>Phi Kappa Psi at the <br>University of Maryland</h1>

	<h2>Our Chapter</h2>

	<br><p>Phi Psi is aware of the unfair stereotype that fraternities get due to our portrayal in popular media. We guarantee that the excessive drinking, hazing, and academic indifference do not characterize how our fraternity does things. We do not haze.  Hazing is an archaic practice, once thought to be an effective way to build brotherhood through physical and mental torment, is now known to be barbaric and ineffective. We do not consider degradation of our potential members an appropriate way to prove their value as brothers. Academically at the University of Maryland, the average GPA of fraternities and sororities is above the all-men's and all-women's average respectively.  Last semester, Phi Psi had the second-highest GPA among all fraternities with a 3.35. Brothers of Phi Kappa Psi also take place in numerous service events, and have ample oppurtunities for developing leadership. If you are still hesitant that joining a fraternity is the best thing your son can do during his college years, we urge you to consider the following statistics.<!--- from <a href="http://www.whygogreek.com">Why Go Greek?</a>--><br><br></p>

	<h2>Statistics</h2>

	<br>According to nationwide study of fraternity and sorority members, by belonging to a fraternity your chances of graduating are greater by up to 10 percent.

	<br><br>As Alumni, Greeks give approximately 75% of all money donated to universities.

	<br><br>As undergraduates, Greeks raise approximately $7 million per year for charities.

	<br><br>As undergraduates, Greeks give approximately 850,000 volunteer hours per year.

	<br><br>Studies prove that Fraternity and Sorority Alumni are much more likely than non-Greeks to participate in community service activities after graduation.

	<br><br>Forty-three of the 100 members of the U.S. Senate are members of a fraternity or sorority.

	<br><br>Thirty-Six percent of the House of Representatives are members of a sorority or fraternity.

	<br><br>Of North America's 50 largest corporations, 43 are headed by Greek men and women, 30% of all Fortune 500's.
