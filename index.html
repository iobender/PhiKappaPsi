	<h2>Welcome to Phi Kappa Psi at the University of Maryland!</h2>

	<br><p>We are an association of men of integrity who strive to develop the individual in his intellect, in his involvement in the community, and in his faith. Recognizing and valuing the diversity of all, the Fraternity unites the principals and traditions of our past with the resources and creativity of our present to provide an environment in which our members can realize their highest potential. To this end, we offer a lifelong experience, guided by our faith in a power greater than ourselves, in contributing to the betterment of both the individual and the community.</p>

After several years on campus, we have a strong relationship with the University and are continuously working on improving the Greek community with our fellow Greek organizations.<br><br></p>

	<h2>Men of Excellence Freshman Scholarship</h2>

	<h3><br>Background of the Men of Excellence Scholarship</h3>
	<p>Now in its 2nd year, the Men of Excellence scholarship aims to reward men with outstanding high school careers entering their first year at the University of Maryland. This $1000 scholarship was established in order to recognize an incoming freshman who lives the values of Phi Kappa Psi which include service, academic excellence, and leadership.<p>

	<h3>The Scholarship Process</h3>
	<p>After the applications have been reviewed, the most qualified applicants will move on to the round of interviews. The initial round of interviews will be conducted over the phone by members of the scholarship committee. The most qualified applicants are named semifinalists. Semifinalists are then interviewed in person during the first week of school. The pool of applicants is then narrowed once more to finalists who are invited to the Men of Excellence Scholarship brunch held in September. Each finalist is recognized at the brunch along with the winners. This presents a great opportunity for the young men to meet their future colleagues and celebrate their accomplishments. The application can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/15SxJlKjgUTmnucOO4M2Ppbzpq9vIf4AMGvg9nujEc2U/viewform">here</a>.</p>
